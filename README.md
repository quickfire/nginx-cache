# nginx-cache

A Node.js module that recursively scans
the directories and files of an _Nginx_ cache
as efficiently as possible
looking for partial URL key matches
based on a regular expression.

This is based on and forked from [lovell/nginx-cache](https://github.com/lovell/nginx-cache) with some updates for newer nodejs versions.

## Install

```sh
npm install @quickfire/qf-nginx-cache
```

## Usage example

Purge all CSS files from an Nginx cache:

```javascript
const NginxCache = require('@quickfire/qf-nginx-cache');

NginxCache('/var/www/cache')
  .find(/.css$/)
  .on('match', function(file, url) {
    console.log('Attempting to remove cached version of ' + url);
    fs.unlink(file, function(err) {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err.message);
      }
    });
  })
  .on('error', function(err) {
    console.log(err.message);
  })
  .on('finish', function() {
    console.log('Done');
  });
```

## API

### NginxCache(directory)

Constructor to which further methods are chained.

* `directory` is the path to the _Nginx_ cache, as provided to its `proxy_cache_path` directive.

### find(pattern)

* `pattern` is an instance of a standard JavaScript `RegExp` object.

### on(event, listener)

Register a function to listen for the given event, where:

* `event` is a String containing the name of the event (see below), and
* `listener` is a function to call when the event is emitted.

#### Event: 'match'

The `match` event is emitted when a cache file matching the `pattern` passed to `find()` is found.

The event attributes are `file, url` where:

* `file` is the full path to the matching cache file, and
* `url` is the full cache key that matched the pattern.

#### Event: 'finish'

The `finish` event is emitted when all cache directories and files have been scanned.
No further events are emitted after this.

#### Event: 'error'

The `error` event is emitted when a non-ignorable problem occurs,
e.g. lack of permission to read files in the cache directory.

#### Event: 'warn'

The `warn` event is emitted when an ignorable problem occurs,
e.g. the Nginx cache manager deleted a file.

## Alternatives

If you know the complete, original cache key
then the commercial _Plus_ version of _Nginx_ provides a
[proxy_cache_purge](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache_purge) directive,
which may be more suitable.
